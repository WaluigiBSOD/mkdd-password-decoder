## Program
The JavaScript source code derives from [Version 1.2.3](https://github.com/WaluigiBSOD/dm64-password-decoder/releases/tag/1.2.3) of [Dr. Mario 64 Password Decoder](https://github.com/WaluigiBSOD/dm64-password-decoder/), another tool I wrote.
Obviously the decoding algorithm is not the same.
