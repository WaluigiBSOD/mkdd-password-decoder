# Mario Kart: Double Dash!! Password Decoder

JavaScript port of [an Adobe Flash application](https://github.com/WaluigiBSOD/mkdd-password-decoder/raw/master/swf/IA9lJeQ.swf) that decodes Mario Kart: Double Dash!! Time Trials contest passwords.

## How to use

1. Play Mario Kart: Double Dash!! and, after completing a race in Time Trials mode, press in sequence **L, R, L, R, X, Y, X, Y, Z** when the options menu is on-screen.
2. Write down the displayed password on the bottom of the screen.
3. Open [https://waluigibsod.github.io/mkdd-password-decoder/](https://waluigibsod.github.io/mkdd-password-decoder/).
4. Enter the password (e.g. `45CJNO5CJILF88Z3`).
5. Read the decoded info.

## Program

It's basically a fork of [Version 1.2.3](https://github.com/WaluigiBSOD/dm64-password-decoder/releases/tag/1.2.3) of [Dr. Mario 64 Password Decoder](https://github.com/WaluigiBSOD/dm64-password-decoder/), another tool I wrote. Obviously the decoding algorithm is not the same.

The Adobe Flash tool was hosted on [FastSWF](https://www.fastswf.com/IA9lJeQ), but since now it's no longer available, the mirror inside this repository it's linked in the description instead.
